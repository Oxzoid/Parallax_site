      <h2>Parallax Scrolling</h2>
      <p>
        I have been programming (not "coding", how awfully, you kids these days,
        say) powerful DOS programs in assembly since 1983 and I don't know any
        of your hipster node.js bullshit that makes you look "cool". Seriously,
        get that shit outta here. You're just making yourself look like clowns
        typing some incomprehensible sugarified as fuck bullshit, half of which,
        in fact, is written by your brand new and shiny Electron-based text
        editor you enjoy every second of, and the other half of which, is copied
        from fucking StackOverflow. Look, we didn't even fucking have that and
        we did shit, and you suckers can't even spend a single second without
        it. You spend hours looking for a gorgeous and flawless color scheme for
        it so your so-called "coding" is always a pleasure for you. We didn't
        even fucking have IntelliSense or linters, you fucking spoiled little
        brats. Stop making programming look like a joke and go back to your
        parents' basements, where you are truly who you are. Burn HTML. Burn
        CSS. Burn JavaScript. Burn PHP. Burn the fucking web. I bet you won't
        even be able to fucking stand writing some C for an embedded system
        without crying to your mommy ... about how there are so fucking many
        compilers errors and everything went not as you expected. You call C
        fucking unsafe? Look at JavaScript. Look at PHP. They let you pull out
        insane bullshit while you don't even notice. And then you spend hours
        trying to find out what you did wrong. C is actually useful. Everything
        you fucking see on your screen has atleast 60% of C or C++ in it. Oh,
        what is JavaScript useful for? Rolling a stupid fucking dropdown menu or
        a sexy as fuck banner animation? I know what you're thinking. And by the
        way, CSS is fucking stupid. It makes no sense half and a quarter of the
        time. Web development is gross. And you know it. You try to compensate
        it by making dumb frameworks that require ages to load because they
        weigh over 16MiB for no fucking reason, but it is no use. Oh, I wonder
        why none of you said anything yet. Probably because I just roasted you
        all hard and you can't deny it.
